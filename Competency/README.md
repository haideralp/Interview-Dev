Alongside got to experience the shadowing of technological projects. Academically, I graduated from King’s with my latest qualification being postgraduate diploma in the neurosciences.

2. What is proudest moment in your life ? 

- During academia, I introduced Neuroscience mental health and well-being sessions. I held seminars as there was little engagement in the cohort. As a result, in year 2 – more people being active, increased social activity. Was recognized among Leadership award top 10 candidates for contributions after completing the pathway.  I strongly believe in giving back to where ever I am present to make a productive and positive environment. 

3.  Do you prefer to work alone or part of a team ? 
 
- Personally, collaboration and working as part of a team is at the heart to my work ethic. However, there are times I have to work independently to be creative and think outside of the box. A good example, was when I had to train 230 advisors plus in 4 weeks on the product launch of Sky Glass (streaming Sky on cloud and no dish) in October 2021.  
-Due to time strain worked independently on hours business can allocate for training, Researched shift of individuals to see availability. Lack of training staff so decided to build a team of champions within the 16 teams. Pitched idea senior management on the idea to get approval. Once I began, organized daily stand-ups, blockers discussed. 
- Results – 200 trained / 87% success rate. Sky Glass -  we were assigned as the main centre for handling such call types due to phenomenal figures of conversion.  Learn interpersonal skills are key for success overall however you have to competent to work alone and for me it works well when I am trying to critical think and be creative.

5. What are your weakneeses and Strengths ?

Weaknesses - I am complete finisher, would only submit high quality work. Submit work as drafts and ask for more time if needed. Example, interview task preparation task - did not complete submit the work as answers were not fully prepared. I took ownsherip and re-done the task with submitting the work I had completed. Fostered a strong communication with my trainer Shahrukh to ensure I am getting regular feedback. I was able to excel.

Strenghts

- Take active leadership in driving tasks or conversations Scrum master - initial week. Did not know people so was confidence to take that step. First presentation - delegation tasks. Result - team started coming together. Conversations engaged and by week 6 we are all flying. 
- Inquistive nature - the why for me is important then just doing something. Example, python coding was new to me. Lots of codes were available. I would go search videos on the concepts and run through. I had improved in my exam score as a result.
