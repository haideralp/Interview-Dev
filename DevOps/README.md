1.  What is DevOps ?

- With so many definitions underlying DevOps philosophy, for me DevOps is a transformational strategy adopted to remove barriers between development and operations teams in software development environment.  The key principles that dictate DevOps for me are fostering strong communication, end-to-end responsibility and information sharing. These define Devops and set goals.  
- Hence, a DevOps engineer is an IT professional with a wide range of knowledge of development and operations, coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps toolchains. 

4.  Why is DevOps beneficial ? 
 
 - Hypercompetitive application market – increase application delivery without compromise on quality. Provides increase productivity to deliver results quicker due to increased collaboration. Generates more creativity and promotes high-quality results.  

5. What is Agile and SCRUM and how have you used it ? 

 
- Agile –is a form of practice / philosophy, and in more business terms it is a project management methodology that is built on 12 key principles. Ever-changing needs – smaller teams more collaborative.  
•	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
•	Responding to change over following a plan 
 
- Scrum – is form of process of this methodology. Identify work, who will work, how will it get done and when will it get completed. Using sprints to break up project into parts.  
 Example – Sky Mobile (Attend Daily Stand up Meetings, part of testing team provider shorter feedback)   
 
6. How does DevOps fit into Agile ?   

- Due to everchanging needs to clients,  a highly efficient process is required to meet the changes in minimal time. For this DevOps comes into play as it provides the ability for quicker release of updates to the client and therefore the consumer market within minutes. A good example, I think of is when Apple launches new features or updates on their IOS system.
