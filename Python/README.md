1. What is OOP ?

A programming model which is mainly organized around the objects is called Object Oriented Programming or the Programming where the main focus of programmer while modeling any problem is objects. 

### The Four Pillars

1. Abstraction - This is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information. (Use public and private modifiers to distinguish public and private display of data)
2. Encapsulation - This is a process of binding data members (variables, properties) and member functions (methods) together. In object oriented programming language we achieve encapsulation through Class. It is used for information hiding. 
3. Inheritance - The process of creating the new class by extending the the existing class is called inheritance or the process of inheriting the features of base class is called as inheritance.
The existing class is called the base class and new class which is created from it is called the derived class.
4. Polymorphism - Poly means many and Morph means forms. Polymorphism is the process in which an object or function take different forms.

1. What is OOP in Python?
    
OOP in Python is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that represent real-world entities. These objects can have their own attributes and methods, which allows for more realistic and complex simulations. OOP in Python also allows for inheritance, meaning that one object can inherit the attributes and methods of another object.

1. Can you explain the four pillars of OOP?

The four pillars of OOP are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts are what make OOP so powerful and allow for the creation of complex programs. Abstraction refers to the ability to take the essential characteristics of an object and ignore the rest. Encapsulation means that the internals of an object are hidden from the outside world, and only the objectâ€™s interface is exposed. Inheritance allows for one object to inherit the characteristics of another object, and polymorphism allows for objects to take on different forms depending on the context.
