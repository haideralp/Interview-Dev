- Agile –is a form of practice / philosophy, and in more business terms it is a project management methodology that is built on 12 key principles. Ever-changing needs – smaller teams more collaborative.  
•	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
•	Responding to change over following a plan 
 
- Scrum – is form of process of this methodology. Identify work, who will work, how will it get done and when will it get completed. Using sprints to break up project into parts.

- Due to everchanging needs to clients,  a highly efficient process is required to meet the changes in minimal time.

A good example, I think of is when Apple launches new features or updates on their IOS system. 

 
  ## 6. Do you prefer to work alone or part of a team ? 
 
- Personally, collaboration and working as part of a team is at the heart to my work ethic. However, there are times I have to work independently to be creative and think outside of the box. A good example, was when I had to train 230 advisors plus in 4 weeks on the product launch of Sky Glass (streaming Sky on cloud and no dish) in October 2021.  
-Due to time strain worked independently on hours business can allocate for training, Researched shift of individuals to see availability. Lack of training staff so decided to build a team of champions within the 16 teams. Pitched idea senior management on the idea to get approval. Once I began, organized daily stand-ups, blockers discussed. 
- Results – 200 trained / 87% success rate. Sky Glass -  we were assigned as the main centre for handling such call types due to phenomenal figures of conversion.  Learn interpersonal skills are key for success overall however you have to competent to work alone and for me it works well when I am trying to critical think and be creative.
