#  Interview Preparation DevOps

## Tell me about yourself ?
- I am Haider, currently employed by Sparta Global and training to step into field as a DevOpss engineer. Professionally, I have 6 years’ experience with telecommunication firm SKY as a subject matter expert in sales, where I was involved in matters of training, leadership and sales. Alongside got to experience the shadowing of technological projects. Academically, I graduated from King’s with my latest qualification being postgraduate diploma in the neurosciences. I have diverse range 
Personally, I am undergoing body transformation and like to go gym 5 times a week with 2 days of learning box. I enjoy playing cricket and also tend to read a lot of personal development books. These activities serve a good way to provide me a work life balance. 
What is proudest moment in your life ? 

- During academia, I introduced Neuroscience mental health and well-being sessions. I held seminars as there was little engagement in the cohort. As a result, in year 2 – more people being active, increased social activity. Was recognized among Leadership award top 10 candidates for contributions after completing the pathway.  I strongly believe in giving back to where ever I am present to make a productive and positive environment. 

##  What is DevOps ?

- With so many definitions underlying DevOps philosophy, for me DevOps is a transformational strategy adopted to remove barriers between development and operations teams in software development environment.  The key principles that dictate DevOps for me are fostering strong communication, end-to-end responsibility and information sharing. These define Devops and set goals.  
- Hence, a DevOps engineer is an IT professional with a wide range of knowledge of development and operations, coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps toolchains. 

 ##  Why is DevOps beneficial ? 
 - Hypercompetitive application market – increase application delivery without compromise on quality. Provides increase productivity to deliver results quicker due to increased collaboration. Generates more creativity and promotes high-quality results.  

## What is Agile and SCRUM and how have you used it ? 

 
- Agile –is a form of practice / philosophy, and in more business terms it is a project management methodology that is built on 12 key principles. Ever-changing needs – smaller teams more collaborative.  
•	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. 
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation. 
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 
•	Responding to change over following a plan 
 
- Scrum – is form of process of this methodology. Identify work, who will work, how will it get done and when will it get completed. Using sprints to break up project into parts.  
 Example – Sky Mobile (Attend Daily Stand up Meetings, part of testing team provider shorter feedback)   
 
## How does DevOps fit into Agile ?   

- Due to everchanging needs to clients,  a highly efficient process is required to meet the changes in minimal time. For this DevOps comes into play as it provides the ability for quicker release of updates to the client and therefore the consumer market within minutes. A good example, I think of is when Apple launches new features or updates on their IOS system. 

 
##  Do you prefer to work alone or part of a team ? 
 
- Personally, collaboration and working as part of a team is at the heart to my work ethic. However, there are times I have to work independently to be creative and think outside of the box. A good example, was when I had to train 230 advisors plus in 4 weeks on the product launch of Sky Glass (streaming Sky on cloud and no dish) in October 2021.  
-Due to time strain worked independently on hours business can allocate for training, Researched shift of individuals to see availability. Lack of training staff so decided to build a team of champions within the 16 teams. Pitched idea senior management on the idea to get approval. Once I began, organized daily stand-ups, blockers discussed. 
- Results – 200 trained / 87% success rate. Sky Glass -  we were assigned as the main centre for handling such call types due to phenomenal figures of conversion.  Learn interpersonal skills are key for success overall however you have to competent to work alone and for me it works well when I am trying to critical think and be creative.  

## What is OOP ?

A programming model which is mainly organized around the objects is called Object Oriented Programming or the Programming where the main focus of programmer while modeling any problem is objects. 

### The Four Pillars
1. Abstraction - This is the process of showing only essential/necessary features of an entity/object to the outside world and hide the other irrelevant information. (Use public and private modifiers to distinguish public and private display of data)
2. Encapsulation - This is a process of binding data members (variables, properties) and member functions (methods) together. In object oriented programming language we achieve encapsulation through Class. It is used for information hiding. 
3. Inheritance - The process of creating the new class by extending the the existing class is called inheritance or the process of inheriting the features of base class is called as inheritance.
The existing class is called the base class and new class which is created from it is called the derived class.
4. Polymorphism - Poly means many and Morph means forms. Polymorphism is the process in which an object or function take different forms.

## What is TDD ?
Test Driven Development is a practice where test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.
### Benefits of TDD: 
1. Better program design and higher code quality --> a very simple and readable code is delivered improving project desing and quality (no repeat codes).
2. Detailed project documentation --> no need for heavy documentations as programmers specify the strict requirements. Includes all user actions likely to take place.
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development --> having clean and error free code means you can save a lot of time in projects due to ease of use.
4. Code flexibility and easier maintenance --> bug free and easier to introduce and reproduce. Can be easily read and understood by non-developers.
5. With TDD you will get a reliable solution --> After refactoring, you and developer has transparency for the reliability of the code. You can be sure the solution works.
Save project costs in the long run --> Decreases costs on projects overall due to multiple benefits as dicussed above. (Code quality, Readable, Scalability)


##  What is Development (Dev) Environment (env) ?
A development environment is a practically workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment. It is the go to place for developers as they deploy changes.
### Benefits of Development environment:
1. Increased colloboration between teams with share responsibilities
2. Improved productivity due to automation of tasks
3. More efficient and streamlines process for developers saving time as they can stay update 4. with latest practices and threats.
4. Provides a creater sense of transpareny on the project so keeping workflow easy to use.
##  What is  Virtualisation ?
Virtualisation means the practice use to generate a simulated environment as opposed to physical one. It often includes computer-generated versions of hardware, operating systems, storage devices and more. You can then parition single computer or server into several virtual machines. Each virtual machine can then interact independently and run different operating systems or applications while sharing the resources of a single host machine.
By creating multiple resources from a single computer or server, virtualisation improves scalability and workloads while resulting in the use of fewer overall servers, less energy consumption, and less infrastructure costs and maintenance.
