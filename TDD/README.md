1. What is TDD ?

    -   Test Driven Development is a practice where test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

### Benefits of TDD: 
1. Better program design and higher code quality --> a very simple and readable code is delivered improving project desing and quality (no repeat codes).
2. Detailed project documentation --> no need for heavy documentations as programmers specify the strict requirements. Includes all user actions likely to take place.
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development --> having clean and error free code means you can save a lot of time in projects due to ease of use.
4. Code flexibility and easier maintenance --> bug free and easier to introduce and reproduce. Can be easily read and understood by non-developers.
5. With TDD you will get a reliable solution --> After refactoring, you and developer has transparency for the reliability of the code. You can be sure the solution works.
Save project costs in the long run --> Decreases costs on projects overall due to multiple benefits as dicussed above. (Code quality, Readable, Scalability)
